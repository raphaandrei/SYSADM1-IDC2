**Course Reflection**

What were your initial expectations for the course? Did the course meet, exceed, or fall short of these expectations?

|I expected to learn the basics of managing and configuring computer systems, networks, and security protocols. I was hoping for a strong foundation to build on, and I'm happy to say the course exceeded my expectations. It not only covered the fundamental concepts but also gave me the practical, hands-on experience I was looking for, which made the learning process more engaging and meaningful.|

What were the main topics or concepts covered in the course? How did these topics contribute to your understanding of the subject matter?

|The course covered a range of topics, including network configuration, user management, system security, troubleshooting, and automation using tools like PowerShell and bash scripting. Each topic built on the previous one, creating a cohesive learning experience that deepened my understanding of how systems operate and interact. This structured approach helped me appreciate the complexities of system administration while equipping me with the skills to manage those complexities effectively.|

Reflecting on your learning process, what were the most effective strategies or techniques that helped you grasp and retain the course material?

|I discovered that active engagement with the material was crucial for retaining knowledge. Strategies like hands-on lab exercises, participating in group discussions, and creating detailed notes helped me internalize the concepts. These techniques also allowed me to connect theoretical knowledge to practical applications, making the learning process more effective and enjoyable.|

Were there any particular assignments, projects, or activities that significantly enhanced your learning experience? Why were they effective?

|One particular activity that significantly enhanced my learning experience was creating an Acceptable Use Policy (AUP). This task stood out because it required me to consider both the technical and ethical aspects of system administration. Developing the policy involved understanding the balance between providing access to resources and maintaining security and compliance within an organization.|

Did you encounter any challenges or difficulties during the course? How did you overcome these obstacles, and what did you learn from them?

|One of the challenges I faced during the course was balancing my time between my studies and my role as the SK Chairman in our town. With responsibilities to the youth and community events, there were times when I missed out on certain course activities or struggled to keep up with the material. To overcome this, I made sure to plan my time better by setting aside specific hours for studying and utilizing any free time between my duties to catch up on assignments. This experience taught me how to manage multiple responsibilities and prioritize tasks, which is an important skill in both life and work.|
| :- |

Did the course encourage critical thinking and analysis? How did it promote higher-order thinking skills, such as problem-solving or decision-making?

|Of course, the journey wasn’t without its challenges. One of the most significant obstacles I faced was mastering scripting for automation. Initially, I struggled with syntax and logic, but consistent practice and seeking help from peers and instructors allowed me to improve significantly. This experience taught me the value of persistence and collaboration in overcoming difficulties.|

How do you plan to apply what you have learned in this course to your future studies, career, or personal life?

|I’ve gained a lot of new knowledge and practical skills that I didn’t have before. I feel more confident in my ability to manage IT infrastructure, and I now have a better understanding of system security and networking. In the future, I plan to apply these skills in both my career and personal projects, especially as I continue to explore a career in IT or cybersecurity. This course has laid a solid foundation for that path, and I feel much more prepared moving forward.|
