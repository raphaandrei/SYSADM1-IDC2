# SYSADM1 – Git Basics
Answer the following research questions about Git, GitLab desktop and GitHub.

1. What is Git, and why is it important in software development?

   Git is a version control system that helps developers track changes in code, collaborate with others, and manage different versions of a project. It’s essential for efficient teamwork and safeguarding code.

1. How does Git track changes in a project?

   Git records changes by capturing snapshots of the project’s files at specific points (commits). It uses these snapshots to keep a history of modifications.

1. What is the difference between a local repository and a remote repository in Git?

   A local repository is stored on your computer, while a remote repository is hosted on a server (GitHub or GitLab) for collaboration and backup. 

1. What are the basic Git commands? 
- git init: Initialize a new repository
- git add: Stage changes
- git commit: Save changes
- git push: Upload changes to a remote repository
- git pull: Fetch and merge updates from a remote repository
1. How do you check the status of a Git repository? 

   Use the command git status to view the current state of your working directory, including changes to be committed or staged.

1. What is the purpose of branches in Git, and how do you create and switch between them?

Branches allow developers to work on features or fixes independently.

- Create: git branch branch\_name
- Switch: git checkout branch\_name or git switch branch\_name
1. What are GitLab Desktop and GitHub, and how are they different from Git?

   GitLab Desktop and GitHub are platforms for hosting Git repositories. They add features like issue tracking and collaboration tools, whereas Git is the underlying version control system.

1. How do you connect a local Git repository to a GitLab or GitHub repository?

   Use git remote add origin <repository\_url> to link your local repository to the remote one.

1. What are the steps to collaborate with others using GitLab or GitHub?	
1. Clone the repository: git clone <repository\_url>
1. Create a branch for your work.
1. Make changes and push them.
1. Submit a pull request for review and merge.
1. How do you resolve merge conflicts in Git?

`                  `Edit the conflicting files manually, save changes, stage the resolved files (git add), and commit the merge (git commit).

1. What is a pull request, and why is it used in GitHub?

   A pull request proposes changes in a repository, allowing team members to review and discuss updates before merging them into the main branch.

1. What are some best practices for writing commit messages?
- Keep messages concise but descriptive.
- Use the imperative mood (e.g., "Add feature X").
- Include a brief explanation of why the change was made.
