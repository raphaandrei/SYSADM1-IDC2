# SYSADM1 – Introduction to File Systems in Windows and Linux
# Requirement: 
- A virtual machine running Linux and Windows OS
# Instructions: 
**Part A: Windows File System**

1. **Open File Explorer:** Click the File Explorer icon on your desktop or press the Windows key + E.
1. **Navigate to your Documents folder:** This is usually the default location for user files.

1. **Copy the text file:** Copy the "info.txt" file to the "Data" subfolder.
1. **Rename the copied file:** Rename the copied file to "data.txt.
1. Create a folder named "LabFiles" with subfolders for each file type. Use the internet for the resources of the files listed below. 

   **LabFiles** 

   1. **Text** 
      1. large\_text.txt
      1. small\_text.txt
      1. code.cpp
   1. **Images**

**6. Backup:**

- Lab1\_Windows, Lab1\_WindowsExtracted, LabFiles, Lab1\_Windows.rar
- Created a compressed file and extracted into another folder.

**7. Comments:**

- This laboratory activity today is relatively easy to do and enjoyable. And with Linus CLI basics, it seems to be the same as before, only with a little difficulty now.
